<p id="p01">Niko Bellic, an eastern European criminal, has taken the Platypus ship to exit the country (namely to avoid an old rival) and comes to Liberty City, after hearing many stories of his cousin, Roman Bellic being a rich man with women, cars, mansions and luxury. Sadly, he discovers in the game's first mission that all Roman told him about were lies. Roman lives in a heavily-cramped apartment and runs a small taxi service. After doing a few chores for Roman, he meets Michelle and Mallorie, who become Niko and Romans girlfriends over time. In the end, Niko ends up dating Michelle before or after saving Roman from Bledar Morina, the head of the Albanian Mafia in Broker.</p>
